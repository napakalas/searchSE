External stress triggers CRH secretion by the hypothalamus.  In turn, this signals to the pituitary to release ACTH which stimulates the adrenal gland to release cortisol.  Cortisol binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (R) in the pituitary and has a negative feedback effect on the release of CRH and ACTH.  In addition, the cortisol-receptor complex has a positive feedback effect, promoting further receptor synthesis.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "gupta_2007.png", "cellml": "CelId-416", "status": 1}, "ImaId-229": {"name": "full_diagram", "caption": "A systems analysis diagram for the full Guyton model describing circulation regulation.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "full_model.png", "cellml": "CelId-418", "status": 1}, "ImaId-230": {"name": "aldosterone_diagram", "caption": "A schematic diagram of the components and processes described in the current CellML model.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "aldosterone.png", "cellml": "CelId-418", "status": 1}, "ImaId-231": {"name": "full_diagram", "caption": "A systems analysis diagram for the full Guyton model describing circulation regulation.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "full_model.png", "cellml": "CelId-419", "status": 1}, "ImaId-232": {"name": "aldosterone_diagram", "caption": "A schematic diagram of the components and processes described in the current CellML model.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "aldosterone.png", "cellml": "CelId-419", "status": 1}, "ImaId-233": {"name": "full_diagram", "caption": "A systems analysis diagram for the full Guyton model describing circulation regulation.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "full_model.png", "cellml": "CelId-425", "status": 1}, "ImaId-234": {"name": "angiotensin_diagram", "caption": "A schematic diagram of the components and processes described in the current CellML model.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "angiotensin.png", "cellml": "CelId-425", "status": 1}, "ImaId-235": {"name": "full_diagram", "caption": "A systems analysis diagram for the full Guyton model describing circulation regulation.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "full_model.png", "cellml": "CelId-429", "status": 1}, "ImaId-236": {"name": "angiotensin_diagram", "caption": "A schematic diagram of the components and processes described in the current CellML model.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "angiotensin.png", "cellml": "CelId-429", "status": 1}, "ImaId-237": {"name": "full_diagram", "caption": "A systems analysis diagram for the full Guyton model describing circulation regulation.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "full_model.png", "cellml": "CelId-434", "status": 1}, "ImaId-238": {"name": "antidiuretic_hormone_diagram", "caption": "A schematic diagram of the components and processes described in the current CellML model.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "antidiuretic_hormone.png", "cellml": "CelId-434", "status": 1}, "ImaId-239": {"name": "full_diagram", "caption": "A systems analysis diagram for the full Guyton model describing circulation regulation.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "full_model.png", "cellml": "CelId-435", "status": 1}, "ImaId-240": {"name": "antidiuretic_hormone_diagram", "caption": "A schematic diagram of the components and processes described in the current CellML model.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "antidiuretic_hormone.png", "cellml": "CelId-435", "status": 1}, "ImaId-241": {"name": "full_diagram", "caption": "A systems analysis diagram for the full Guyton model describing circulation regulation.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "full_model.png", "cellml": "CelId-439", "status": 1}, "ImaId-242": {"name": "atrial_natriuretic_peptide_diagram", "caption": "A schematic diagram of the components and processes described in the current CellML model.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "atrial_natriuretic_peptide.png", "cellml": "CelId-439", "status": 1}, "ImaId-243": {"name": "full_diagram", "caption": "A systems analysis diagram for the full Guyton model describing circulation regulation.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "full_model.png", "cellml": "CelId-440", "status": 1}, "ImaId-244": {"name": "atrial_natriuretic_peptide_diagram", "caption": "A schematic diagram of the components and processes described in the current CellML model.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "atrial_natriuretic_peptide.png", "cellml": "CelId-440", "status": 1}, "ImaId-245": {"name": "full_diagram", "caption": "A systems analysis diagram for the full Guyton model describing circulation regulation.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "full_model.png", "cellml": "CelId-442", "status": 1}, "ImaId-246": {"name": "autonomics_diagram", "caption": "A schematic diagram of the components and processes described in the current CellML model.

The ATP production module communicates with the ACP module via uptake of Pi and exchange of ADP for ATP across the MIM.

Some tumour cells also express FasL, and T-cells express up-regulated Fas, probably because of activation in response to tumour antigen. This enables the tumour to counterattack the cytotoxic T-cells: FasL expressed on tumour cells binds to Fas on the T-cells, which then die by apoptosis before they can attack the tumour.

Components of the ACP module are shown in black. Mitochondrial ATP production and the cytosolic ATPase catalyzing ATP hydrolysis are not considered to be part of the ACP module. These adjacent modules, which communicate with the ACP module, are shown in gray. The input to the ACP module is the ATP hydrolysis forcing function (ATPase), representing ATP splitting by contractile proteins and ion pumps. The hydrolyzed ATP is resynthesized in the mitochondrial matrix via oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and exported across the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM). The ATP production module communicates with the ACP module via uptake of Pi and exchange of ADP for ATP across the MIM. Concentration changes of ATP, ADP, and Pi are influenced by the reaction of ATP with creatine (Cr), yielding phosphocreatine (PCr) and ADP, catalyzed by isoforms of creatine kinase (CK) enzymes. CK has a muscular isoform (MM-CK) in the cytosol and a mitochondrial isoform (Mi-CK) in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Note that Pi is not handled by CK and diffuses directly between the compartments without taking part in chemical reactions. PCr and Cr have higher diffusivity than the adenine nucleotides. The permeability to ADP and ATP of the outer mitochondrial membrane (MOM), which separates the compartments, may be restricted and is an important parameter varied in the model analysis.", "title": "", "path": "vanbeek_2007.png", "celml": "CelId-2120"}, "ImaId-976": {"name": "fig_reaction_diagram", "caption": "A detailed mechanistic model of the GI/S transition in the mammalian cell cycle.", "title": "Figure 1", "path": "aguda_1999a.png", "celml": "CelId-2121"}, "ImaId-977": {"name": "fig_reaction_diagram", "caption": "pRB-independant pathways leading to activation of CycE/Cdk2.", "title": "Figure 2", "path": "aguda_1999b.png", "celml": "CelId-2121"}, "ImaId-978": {"name": "fig_reaction_diagram", "caption": "Schematic diagram of SERCA pump.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "koivumaki_2009a.png", "celml": "CelId-2122"}, "ImaId-979": {"name": "fig_reaction_diagram", "caption": "Schematic diagram of the cell model.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "koivumaki_2009b.png", "celml": "CelId-2123"}, "ImaId-980": {"name": "fig_reaction_diagram", "caption": "Schematic diagram of the cell model.", "title": "model diagram", "path": "koivumaki_2009b.png", "celml": "CelId-2124"}, "ImaId-981": {"name": "fig_cell_diagram", "caption": "Schematic diagram of the human atrial myocyte model.
